We have sent out invitations to potential program committee members. In about 10% of cases, our invitation emails bounced because the individual's email in START was not up to date. We estimate that an additional 10% of invitations have been unread due to the same issue. If you would like to be considered for the NAACL-HLT 2018 program committee and have not received an invitation, please (a) send email to the program chairs at [naacl2018-program@googlegroups.com](mailto:naacl2018-program@googlegroups.com)Â and (b) verify your email in START.
