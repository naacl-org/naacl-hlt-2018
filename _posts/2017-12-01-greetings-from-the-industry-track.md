As Lyn mentioned in the first blog post, an industry track, which focuses
on disseminating results from applying NLP technology to real world
applications, will debut at NAACL 2018. We are very excited to
co-chair this new track and look forward to putting together an
interesting program with your contribution and participation!

Why an Industry Track?
----------------------

The idea of an industry track stemmed from the challenging issues
encountered while attempting to apply state-of-the-art techniques to
real-world language problems. As those who have attempted these
problems know, practical applications are rarely as well defined as in
laboratory settings and the data never as clean. In addition, there
may be practical constraints with respect to processing speed that
need to be met. The NAACL 2018 Industry Track was born out of
the desire to provide a forum for researchers and application developers
who are experienced in these issues to exchange ideas and share 
results and insightful anecdotes.

So, if you have experience in applying NLP technologies to practical
applications and have interesting results (either positive or
negative) to share, we would love for you to consider submitting a
paper! We welcome papers covering a wide range of topics, including, but not limited to,
novel practical solutions to known problems, evaluation methodologies,
and implementation at scale. All papers will be reviewed by three
reviewers on the program committee. For more information, including
submission instructions, please see the [Industry Track Call For Papers](http://naacl2018.org/industry.html).


What Else Will There Be Other Than Papers?
------------------------------------------

In addition to paper presentations sessions, we are in the process of putting
together a program that includes keynote speakers and panel
discussions. Keynotes will feature experienced researchers
who also have first hand experience applying those research results to
practical applications. We are also planning on organizing panel discussions on focused topics that may be of interest to specific
segments of the NAACL audience. Some topics under consideration
revolve around careers in industry and entrepreneurship. We recently sent out a
[survey](https://goo.gl/forms/Q9AJ7PwLNzSAjKhg2) to the ACL membership soliciting suggestions on panel topics. If you have anything you'd like to see, please fill out the
survey or get in touch with us directly.

All Industry Track sessions will run as a parallel session during the main
conference days.


Got Ideas? Want to Help?
------------------------

If you have anything specific you would like to see happen in the industry
track, or if you would like to contribute to the reviewing process,
please contact us at naacl2018-industrial-track@googlegroups.com. We
look forward to hearing from you and seeing you in New Orleans!
