This year we are using the Toronto Paper Matching System (TPMS) as a precursor to bidding. So, a reviewer will see papers sorted by match to them. The goal is to reduce the work load for reviewers. 

If you don't want to use this feature you don't have to but we urge you to consider it. Imagine bidding on at least 1200 submissions sorted at random.

Your TPMS profile only need be set up once, so if you already have one from a previous conference you are fine.

Best
