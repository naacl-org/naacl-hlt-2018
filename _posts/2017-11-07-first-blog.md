NAACL-HLT 2018 Chairs Blog
==========================

Hi,

Welcome to the NAACL-HLT 2018 Blog! As General Chair, and on behalf of the whole organizing committee, we invite you to participate in NAACL in in New Orleans, where we expect to host the biggest NAACL ever. The program chairs Amanda Stent (Bloomberg) and Heng Ji (RPI) have put together a great program committee with 69 area chairs!  We have been busy getting all the calls out.  Don’t forget, the research papers long paper deadline is December 15th, and the short paper deadline is January 15th.

As in the past, NAACL will feature research papers, demo papers, workshops, and tutorials, each with their own calls for participation on naacl2018.org. This NAACL will also feature, for the first time, an independent industry track, with its own chairs and committee.  The industry track’s aim is to create a venue for papers that particularly focus on issues of scale, robustness and maintainability that arise when NLP technologies are fielded in a commercial setting. This track should help ensure that the research community gets to hear about the insights from industrial deployments of NLP technology, at this exciting time, when NLP is having a huge impact on technology. The three industry track chairs Yunyao Li (IBM) Srinivas Bangalore (Interactions) and Jennifer Chu-Carroll (Elemental Cognition), are putting together a program which will include panels on careers in industry,  and  on entrepreneurship, as well as research papers with an industry application focus.  Please see the Industry Track Call for Papers at naacl2018.org (paper deadline is February 20th, 2018).  Let me or the industry track chairs know if you have any questions!

Best,
Marilyn
