**Award**: Test-of-Time Paper on Computational Linguistics

**Goal and Criteria**: We aim to select 1-3 influential and inspiring Computational Linguistics (CL) papers which were published between 2002-2012 at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conferences (including ACL, NAACL and EACL), workshops and journals (including TACL and CL journal), to recognize research that has had long-lasting influence until today, including positive impact on a subarea of CL, across subareas of CL, and outside of the CL research community. These papers may have proposed new research directions and new technologies, or released results and resources that have greatly benefit the community.

**By Dec 31, 2017**: The nomination committee will consist of all NAACL-HLT 2018 area chairs. Each area will nominate up to three papers based on joint desisions from all co-chairs, and send the following information to the award committee:

* Paper Title
* Paper Author(s)
* Justification on the merits of the nominated papers.

The area chairs could solicit feedback from the CL community, and rank their nominations if necessary.

**By Jan 15, 2018**: A separate award committee will be formed, independent of area chairs. The award committee will consist of the NAACL-HLT 2018 general chair, program chairs, the NAACL board chair, some keynote speakers, and some senior leading experts to cover all areas. All of the award committee members should have no COIs with any of the nominated papers.

**By March 1, 2018**: The award committee will rank the nominated papers based on justifications received from area chairs and other objective criteria including citation, and select 1-3 papers for the test-of-time award. The PC chairs will announce the award and invite authors to present their papers at a plenary session at NAACL-HLT 2018. If the authors are not available, we will ask the nominating area chair(s) to present the papers.
