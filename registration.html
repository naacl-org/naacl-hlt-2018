            <p>We are working on the Registration Form and it will be available close to the end of March. We hope to be able to keep registration fees almost the same as the last two years. Below are the recent conference fees for your convenience in making your plans to attend the conference. If the fees need to be higher, they should not go up more than about 10% at most.</p>
            <h3>Registration Fees</h3>
            <p>The table below shows the registration fees of ACL/NAACL 2017.</p>
